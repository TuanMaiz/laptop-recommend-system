Seminar Structure

1. Introduction (5 minutes)

•    The Problem: The difficulty of choosing a laptop from thousands of available options.
•    The Solution: A recommendation system that intelligently guides users to the best laptop for their needs.
•    Our Approach: Using a knowledge-based system to capture the complex relationships between laptop features and user requirements.
•    Agenda: Briefly walk through the topics that will be covered in the seminar.

2. Background & Motivation (5 minutes)

•    Existing Solutions: Briefly discuss other types of recommendation systems (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based).
•    Why a Knowledge-Based Approach? Explain why a knowledge-based system is particularly well-suited for this problem, as it can reason about specifications and make recommendations even for new laptops with no user ratings.

3. System Architecture & Design (10 minutes)

•    High-Level Overview: A diagram showing the main components of your system (e.g., User Interface, Recommendation Engine, Knowledge Base).
•    Knowledge Representation:
◦    How you modeled the "laptop domain."
◦    The ontology (classes, properties, and relationships) you created for laptops, components (CPU, GPU, RAM), and user profiles (e.g., "student," "gamer," "developer").
•    Data Acquisition: How you collected and cleaned the data for your knowledge base.

4. Implementation (10 minutes)

•    Technology Stack: The programming languages, libraries, and tools you used (e.g., Python, Protégé, SPARQL).
•    Recommendation Logic:
◦    A step-by-step explanation of how a recommendation is generated.
◦    Show how user queries are translated into a format that your system can understand (e.g., SPARQL queries).
•    Code Examples: Show snippets of your code to illustrate the key parts of your implementation.

5. Demonstration (5 minutes)

•    A live demo of your laptop recommendation system in action.
•    Scenario 1: A student looking for a lightweight and affordable laptop for note-taking and research.
•    Scenario 2: A software developer looking for a powerful machine for coding and running virtual machines.

6. Evaluation & Future Work (5 minutes)

•    Evaluation:
◦    How you measured the quality of your recommendations (e.g., user satisfaction surveys, comparison with expert opinions).
•    Future Work:
◦    Potential improvements, such as incorporating user reviews, price tracking, or expanding the knowledge base with more product categories.

7. Conclusion & Q&A (5 minutes)

•    Summary: Recap the key achievements of your project.
•    Q&A: Open the floor for questions.
